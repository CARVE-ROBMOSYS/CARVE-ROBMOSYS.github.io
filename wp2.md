This work package is implemented by two tasks:


- Task 2.1 Specifications of scenarios: this task defines the environment
assumptions and the target goals of the three validation scenarios, to allow modularity and reuse
in behavior definition with the system level specifications for the three target applications,
which will be the basis for the activities of Task2.2. The validation scenarios are available at the following links: 
  - [Scenario 1](scenario1)
  - [Scenario 2](scenario2)
  - [Scenario 3](scenario3)

<br>
- Task 2.2 Implementation of scenarios and validation: based on existing components
for speech recognition, SLAM, object recognition, grasping and obstacle avoidance, this
task develops BTs and models for execution and orchestration of the components for the implementation
of the three scenarios. Safety constraints in Scenario 3 will be validated with the tools
developed in Work Package 5. [Deliverable2.2](https://github.com/CARVE-ROBMOSYS/Coordination/blob/master/deliverables/D2.2-Models%20of%20components%20and%20BTs%20for%20scenario1-3.pdf) presents the results obtained within this task.
