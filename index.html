The goal of CARVE is to propose Behavior Trees (BTs) for modelling composable and reusable behaviors and propose the use of formal methods for increasing confidence in their correct execution. The tools developed in CARVE are validated on real-world scenario using the R1 humanoid robot. The integration of the YARP middleware (used on the R1 robot) and the SmartSoft toolkit helps disseminating the RobMoSys approach to the research community.
