CARVE is an Integrated Tecnical Partner (ITP) of the European Union project RobMosys.  The project ran from March 2018 to March 2019.  

<p>
The projects is motivated by the fact that software development in robotics typically focuses on individual components, whereas component's orchestration receives much less attention. This fact makes software behaviors usually application-dependent and are therefore hardly reusable. Moreover, there is little or no use of formal verification tools for assessing properties of component's orchestration.

<p>
The objectives of the CARVE projects are: use Behavior Trees (BTs) for modelling composable and reusable behaviors; a set of verification tools for increasing confidence in correct robot behaviors; validation of the approach in a real-world scenario; and fostering adoption of RobMoSys ecosystem in the research community


<p>
The tools developed in CARVE are validated on real-world scenario using the R1 humanoid robot. The integration of the YARP middleware (used on the R1 robot) and the SmartSoft toolkit helps disseminating the RobMoSys approach to the research community.

The CARVE project has received funding from the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant agreement No 732410, in the form of financial support to third parties of the RobMoSys project.
